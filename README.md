A simple mobile-first webapp that sends questions to users and slightly gamifies the review experience. I built this as my first Javascript based webapp back in 2015.

It utilizes spaced repetition and dopamine-based rewards to encourage users to review regularly.

_Technologies used: PHP, Javascript, jQuery_

## Some features:
1. Create and join teams for support and stickiness
2. Short snackable timed quizzes based on past exams. This was because the actual exam had very strict time constraints.
3. Colorful and friendly design to encourage exam taking.
4. Gamified using quests, digital rewards, leaderboards, and streaks.
